    "Monte Carlo methods refer to a broad class of stochastic algorithms that try to solve problems using random numbers. The name Monte Carlo was given by Metropolis referring to the extensive use of random numbers, like in a casinò in Monte Carlo.\n",

    "Metropolis, Von Neumann and Ulam were the first to develop a Monte Carlo Method between 1940 and 1950 while working at Los Alamos laboratory[].\n",

    "Today the Monte Carlo method is one of the most communly used to technique to study complex system. Its application ranges from physical and chemical problems such as the Ising model [], Ensemble sampling [], Chemical reactions[] to social sciences (e.g. Schelling model[]) and Epidemiology (e.g. Covid Simulations []).\n",

    "The time evolution of a broad range of systems in biology, chemistry, and physics\n",
    "can be modeled in two fundamental ways: deterministically and stochastically. In\n",
    "a deterministic approach, time evolution is treated as a continuous process which is\n",
    "represented by a set of ordinary differential equations. In a stochastic approach, time\n",
    "evolution takes the form of a Markovian random walk which can be described by a\n",
    "differential-difference equation. As the algorithms presented in Chapter 3 simulate\n",
    "the evolution of chemical systems, we will discuss the two approaches in this context.\n",
    "Consider a system of chemical reactions in which the number of each chemical\n",
    "species is represented by Xi, i = 1, . . . ,N. Although molecular populations in a\n",
    "chemical system change only by discrete integer amounts, the traditional approach\n",
    "to simulating a reaction network involves constructing a set of coupled ordinary differential\n",
    "equations of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where the functions fi result from the stoichiometric forms and rate constants of\n",
    "each reaction. Solving the system of differential equations produces the molecular\n",
    "population levels as a function of time. Furthermore, solution of\n",
    "\n",
    "provides the equilibrium concentrations of the chemical system\n",
    "\n",
    "In this system, ; acts as a source to the molecule I and a sink to the molecule P.\n",
    "Equation (2.3) describes how I is produced with rate k1 and how P arises from I\n",
    "with rate k2 but degrades with rate k3. This reaction is coupled with equation (2.4)\n",
    "in which the degradation of I is catalyzed by a signal molecule S with rate k4. The\n",
    "production and degradation of S with rates k5 and k6 respectively is provided in\n",
    "equation (2.5). By the law of mass action, the time evolution of the concentrations\n",
    "of I, P, and S can be described by the system of ordinary differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the equilibrium points of the system, we set equations (2.6)–(2.8) equal\n",
    "to zero and solve for I, S, and P; this yields the number of each species in terms of\n",
    "the rate constants of the reactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a deterministic formulation such as this is sufficient for some chemically\n",
    "reacting systems, there are many cases in which the differential reaction-rate equations\n",
    "fail to accurately describe the fluctuations in the molecular species. Collisions\n",
    "in a system of molecules occur in a seemingly random manner, a behavior which is\n",
    "more appropriately accounted for in a stochastic formulation. In this approach, the\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "reaction constants are viewed as probabilities per unit time and the time evolution\n",
    "of the system is governed by a single differential-difference equation constructed according\n",
    "to the laws of probability. Details of the stochastic framework are made clear\n",
    "following the introduction of necessary terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a chemical system with N species Xj , j = 1, . . . ,N and denote the population\n",
    "levels of Xj molecules at time t as Xj(t). Suppose the molecular species may\n",
    "interact through a set of M chemical reactions and let Ri refer to the ith reaction\n",
    "where 1 \u0014 i \u0014 M. The occurrence of a chemical reaction in a system effects change\n",
    "in the molecular population values. For a given reaction R, define the set of reactant\n",
    "molecules as Depends(R) and the set of all species that have their copy numbers\n",
    "changed when the reaction is executed as Affects(R). To update the molecular population\n",
    "values following a reaction, let \u0017i 2 RN be a vector of coefficients that adjusts\n",
    "the copy numbers of each species with respect to the reaction Ri. Furthermore, define\n",
    "the state vector v to contain the number of molecules of each species present in the\n",
    "system at a given time t\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The reaction Ri is also characterized by its propensity ai, which is determined by\n",
    "the mesoscopic rate constant of the reaction and the state of the system. Assuming\n",
    "the system is in thermal equilibrium, the molecules are uniformly distributed and\n",
    "collisions between molecules occur at random. A collision takes place, however, only\n",
    "if the center-to-center distance between two molecules is no greater than the sum\n",
    "of their radii. The propensity of a reaction thus involves the probability of reactant\n",
    "molecules colliding as well as the probability that a reaction occurs upon this collision.\n",
    "We therefore define the propensity function ai(v) such that aidt is the probability\n",
    "that an Ri reaction will occur in the infinitesimal time interval (t, t+dt) given that the\n",
    "system was in state v at time t. This definition is often regarded as the fundamental\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "hypothesis of stochastic chemical kinetics [4,5,7].\n",
    "To provide an example of the definitions highlighted above, consider the chemical\n",
    "system presented in equations (2.3) through (2.5). We have that the state vector is\n",
    "given by the population of each molecular species, v = (I(t), S(t), P(t)). The table\n",
    "below gives the propensity and state-change vector \u0017 for each reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the time evolution of a chemical system is constructed through the\n",
    "solution of a differential-difference equation. Termed the master equation, the equation\n",
    "concerns the function P(v, t|v0, 0), which is the probability that the system is in\n",
    "state v at time t given that it was in state v0 at time t = 0. To derive the equation,\n",
    "we consider the number of ways in which the system can arrive at state v in the\n",
    "time interval (t, t + dt). The possible routes from state v0 to v include no reaction\n",
    "occurring in (t, t + dt), exactly one reaction occurring, and more than one reaction\n",
    "occurring. All of these events are mutually exclusive and so the probability that any\n",
    "of them occur can be calculated by summing their individual probabilities [6], which\n",
    "gives\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the master equation exactly describes the time evolution of a system,\n",
    "its formulation and solution is not always plausible. For example, a model of the\n",
    "virus lambda phage contains 75 equations in 57 species [3]; writing down the master\n",
    "equation for such a large system, let alone solving it, would be a tremendous undertaking.\n",
    "Stochastic simulation algorithms, which will be discussed in Chapter 3, offer\n",
    "a more feasible approach; these algorithms generate the exact probability of a system\n",
    "following a given trajectory as predicted by the master equation without the need for\n",
    "such an equation to be explicitly expressed.\n",
    "10\n",
    "\n",
    "Random\n",
    "variate generation from a dynamic probability distribution allows the kinetic Monte\n",
    "Carlo method to choose an event and its associated timestep to advance the system\n",
    "accordingly. With the transition rates tied to the underlying state space of the system,\n",
    "kinetic Monte Carlo simulations produce a temporal evolution that corresponds to\n",
    "the solution of the space-time partial differential equation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1976, Daniel T. Gillespie devised an algorithm that provides an exact solution\n",
    "to the chemical master equation using Monte Carlo methods. Named the stochastic\n",
    "simulation algorithm, the formulation is equivalent to the classical KMC algorithm\n",
    "referred to as the Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitiz (BKL) algorithm, or n-fold way, although\n",
    "it was discovered independently. Gillespie proposed two variants of his stochastic\n",
    "simulation algorithm, the direct method and the first reaction method [4,5,7]; these\n",
    "developments of the kinetic Monte Carlo method are presented in sections 3.2 and 3.3\n",
    "respectively. Improving upon the computational cost associated with Gillespie’s algorithms,\n",
    "Michael A. Gibson and Jehoshua Bruck published the next-reaction method\n",
    "in 2000 [3]. The algorithm more efficiently selects a reaction in each iteration of the\n",
    "simulation by using an indexed priority queue or binary tree; the details of this approach\n",
    "are provided in section 2.4. In 2008, Alexander Slepoy, Aidan P. Thompson,\n",
    "and Steven J. Plimpton offered a further refinement to the stochastic simulation algorithm,\n",
    "achieving a computational cost independent of the number of reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This constant-time algorithm, which institutes a composition and rejection scheme, is\n",
    "discussed in section 2.5. To conclude the chapter, we explore how the kinetic Monte\n",
    "Carlo method may be implemented to study the evolution of a crystalline structure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a spatially homogeneous system of N different chemical species\n",
    "which are subject to the reactions Ri, i = 1, . . . ,M. Assume that the system is\n",
    "restricted to a volume V in which the molecular species are in thermal equilibrium.\n",
    "Under this assumption, the molecules are uniformly distributed in V and their velocities\n",
    "follow a Boltzmann distribution; these characteristics permit the model to ignore\n",
    "nonreactive molecular collisions and simply be concerned with those that are reactive\n",
    "[7]. Let Xj(t) denote the number of molecules of species j in the system at time\n",
    "t. To describe the change in the molecular populations at a given time, Gillespie’s\n",
    "algorithm seeks to answer two questions: at what time does the next reaction occur\n",
    "and which reaction will it be?\n",
    "The aforementioned questions may be resolved by determining the probability\n",
    "density P(\u001c, μ) that the next reaction is Rμ and will occur in the time interval (t +\n",
    "\u001c, t + \u001c + d\u001c). This function is a joint probability density function on the space of\n",
    "two random variables, the time until the next reaction \u001c and the index of the next\n",
    "reaction μ. To derive an exact formula for P(\u001c, μ), we apply the laws of probability\n",
    "\n",
    "to the fundamental hypothesis of chemical kinetics. Considering that a reaction’s\n",
    "propensity ai depends on the physical properties of the involved molecules and the\n",
    "temperature of the system, we define the probability that an Rμ reaction will take\n",
    "place in the next infinitesimal time interval as aμd\u001c. Furthermore, define P0(\u001c ) to\n",
    "be the probability that given that the system is in state v at time t, no reaction will\n",
    "occur in the time interval (t, t + \u001c ). Using these definitions, we may write P(\u001c, μ)d\u001c\n",
    "as the product of the probability that no reaction occurs within \u001c time units and the\n",
    "probability that an Rμ reaction occurs in the next d\u001c time unit\n",

    "To derive an analytical expression for P0(\u001c ), we divide the time interval (t, t + \u001c )\n",
    "\n",
    "into K subintervals of length \u000f = \u001c/K. By the fundamental hypothesis and the\n",
    "multiplication theorem of probability, the probability that no reaction occurs in the\n",
    "time interval (t, t + \u000f) is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "As this also provides the probability that no reaction occurs in subsequent subintervals,\n",
    "P0(\u001c ) can be expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the limit as K approaches infinity, we obtain the probability that none of the\n",
    "M reactions occur in any of the K subintervals\n",
    "\n",
    "By inserting this expression into equation (3.1), we find that the reaction probability\n",
    "density function is given by\n",

    "framework through which this can be accomplished. As the system takes the form of\n",
    "a continuous-time Markov chain, it exhibits a memoryless property; specifically, the\n",
